      "The results of the dispersion modelling indicate that the predicted annual average PM2.5, PM10, TSP, and dust deposition at the closest sensitive receptors are all expected to comply with the relevant assessment criteria, even considering the existing air quality. However, when analyzing the maximum predicted 24-hour average concentrations, receptor R8 is anticipated to experience one additional exceedance of the relevant criterion for PM10 on a cumulative basis, that is, considering the existing background concentrations. Given the limitations of dispersion modelling in accurately predicting 24-hour average concentrations, it is considered that, with appropriate management measures, exceedances are unlikely to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surrounding land use is predominantly rural and bushland with significant sand extraction activity, both by PF Formation and other companies. AERMOD was chosen as the most suitable model due to its applicability to the source types, location of nearest receivers, and the nature of local topography. AERMOD is the US-EPA’s recommended steady-state plume dispersion model for regulatory purposes and is now commonly applied to air quality assessments in NSW, accepted by the NSW EPA. The dispersion modelling suggests compliance with annual average PM2.5, PM10, TSP, and dust deposition criteria at the closest sensitive receptors, even considering existing air quality. The implementation of appropriate management practices should minimize potential additional exceedances at R8. Considering the conservative nature of the assessment, dispersion modelling limitations, and proposed management measures, it is anticipated that exceedances are unlikely to occur in practice.\n",

      "## Air Quality Criteria\n",
      "The potential emissions to air from the proposal include fugitive dust emissions from activities such as sand extraction, hauling, and site rehabilitation, and combustion emissions from diesel in quarrying equipment. The assessment focuses on Particulate Matter (PM) emissions. The criteria for assessing air quality impacts include health-based standards from the NSW EPA and NEPM, considering cumulative impacts. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Emission Summary\n",
      "Proposed activities may generate fugitive dust, with diesel equipment emissions contributing to fine particulate matter. The Approved Methods specify air quality goals that account for cumulative impacts due to the proposal and other sources. \n",
